# Unit-14---LSTM-Stock-Predictor
Due to the volatility of cryptocurrency speculation, investors will often try to incorporate sentiment from social media and news articles to help guide their trading strategies. One such indicator is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) which attempts to use a variety of data sources to produce a daily FNG value for cryptocurrency.
## In this assignment:
- I will use deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. 
- I will have one model  use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.
